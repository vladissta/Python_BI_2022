I've been a beggar and I've been a king
I've been a loner and I've won the reign
Losing myself just to find me again
I'm a million miles smarter, but I ain't learnt a thing
I've been a teacher and a student of hurt
I've kept my word for whatever that's worth
Never been last, but I've never been first
Oh I may not be the best, but I'm far from the worst
Oh I may not be the best, but I'm far from the worst

Oh I've seen trouble more than any man should bare
But I've seen enough joy, I've had more than my share
I'm still not done, I'm only halfway there
I'm a million miles ahead of where I'm from
But I still have another million miles to go

Why I keep on searching for the city of gold
I'm gonna follow this yellow brick road
Thinking it maybe, it might lead me home
I'm a million miles farther and a long way from home
I know that there's a plan that goes way beyond mine
I got to step back just to see the design
The mind fears the heart but the heart doesn't mind

Oh I may not be perfect, but I'm loving this life
Oh I may not be perfect, but I'm loving this life
Oh I've seen trouble more than any man should bare
But I've seen enough joy, I've had more than my share
I'm still not done, I'm only halfway there
I'm a million miles ahead of where I'm from
But I still have another million miles to go
